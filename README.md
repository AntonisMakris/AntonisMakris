I'm currently work at the [Department of Informatics and Telematics](https://www.dit.hua.gr/index.php/en/) of Harokopio University of Athens as a **Research Associate**.

This period I am working on the implementation of a distributed edge storage framework spread across heterogeneous edge and cloud nodes, with intelligent decisions on data placement, data caching and considerations on performance (QoE) and security. In addition, I am implementing a global-scale, real-time, anomaly detection system for vessels, using AIS data streams (distributed systems, machine learning, CEP, all in the mix). Furthermore, I am passionate about implementing CNN models and exploring DL in general, for the classification of CT DICOM images. 

You can find more about me in my [personal page](https://www.dit.hua.gr/~amakris/).



My research interests include:
- Distributed computing
- Edge and Cloud computing
- Edge storage
- Big data management and analysis
- NoSQL database systems
- High performance computing (HPC)
- Spatiotemporal and trajectory analysis
- Stream processing
- Deep Learning (CNNs, RNNs)
